 <p> Today's topic is going to be the Edmonton Oilers. The Edmonton Oilers are an organization that has been at the bottom of the leaderboards for some years.
 They have gotten a lot of top picks like Taylor Hall being the #1 pick in 2010, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins being the #1 pick in 2011, Nail Yakupov being the #1 pick 
 in 2012, Darnell Nurse being the #7 pick in 2013, Leon Draisaitl being the #3 pick in 2014, CONNOR MCDAVID being the #1 pick in 2015 and Jesse Puljujarvi
 being the #4 pick in 2016. But they always managed to stay at the bottom even last year with Connor McDavid, the best player in the league!!! But this year
 that has all changed, not only are they not at the bottom, they are actually in a playoff spot. Even while letting go of Nail Yakupov and Taylor Hall, they
 are having one of their best seasons in a while. Who thinks that Connor McDavid is the best player in the NHL and who thinks that they have a chance at
 winning the Stanley cup this year. </p>

 <p> This is a new segment where I will be talking about anything special that happens in the whole league not only Montreal. Starting off by saying congrats
 to Ovechkin for getting his 1000th point. What an achivement to earn by the beast himself. One of the best goalscorers of all time, having over 500 goals.
 Winning the Maurice Richard trophy the past four years. But this year he is falling off only having 22 goals, still good but Crosby having 28 goals maybe
 wanting to take that trophy this year. This might be the year that is confirmed that Crosby is better than Ovechkin. Crosby has always been considered 
 amazing but Ovechkin has always leaded the goal scoring category. If Crosby takes that category then it will cement his greatness over Ovechkin. </p>
