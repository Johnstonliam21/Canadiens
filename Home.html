 <p> This is a new segment where I will be talking about anything special that happens in the whole league not only Montreal. Starting off by saying congrats
 to Ovechkin for getting his 1000th point. What an achivement to earn by the beast himself. One of the best goalscorers of all time, having over 500 goals.
 Winning the Maurice Richard trophy the past four years. But this year he is falling off only having 22 goals, still good but Crosby having 28 goals maybe
 wanting to take that trophy this year. This might be the year that is confirmed that Crosby is better than Ovechkin. Crosby has always been considered 
 amazing but Ovechkin has always leaded the goal scoring category. If Crosby takes that category then it will cement his greatness over Ovechkin. </p>
