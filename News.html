 <!--January 10 post-->
 <p> It's been a while and a lot has happened so let's get right into the news. Montreal is still a contender for the presidence cup but has stumbled down
 the leaderboards a bit. Minnesota and Columbus went on huge streaks and are now leading the league. Montreal is still one point in front of Minnesota but
 behind Columbus by 4 points. We are loosing more games now than before because of injuries. Galchenyuk is still injured with a knee injury and Gallagher
 is also out with an upper body injury. Both of these players are huge contributors to the team. Shea Weber is still coming in clutch with 10 goals, 8
 coming from the powerplay. The powerplay with Weber essentially becomes a 4-3 because they have to keep a man on Weber or he will score. So we played
 against Nashville and we did not get to see Suban but they did get to see Weber and he was applauded upon stepping on the ice and he also ended up scoring 
 the OT winner. What a huge goal to score for him. Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday! Do you guys think we can win the presidence cup?  <pre> January 10, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> Montreal vs Colorado, what an unbelievable game. The habs scoring 10 goals in one game! Making up for the 10-1 loss a while back. Pacioretty finally
 scores goals when they are useless ones. He had a total of six points at the most meaningless time. Nothing really else to say than wow. <pre> December 12, 2016 </pre>

 <p> We took on the Devils yesterday and im sure that all our fans were scared for Price's safety. Kyle Palmiery slide into him more than once.
 He took hits to the recovered leg twice. I have never seen Price get so angry. He went hacking away at Palmiery's back and almost got tossed. If one of those
 strike's hits Palmiery's head then Price gets tossed. Besides the fact, the whole team played fantastic yesterday lighting up Corey Schneider with a total of
 49 shots and scoring five goals. Great performances came from Gallagher, Danault, Shaw and Mitchell, all having multiple points games. <pre> December 9, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> Yesterday we finished our road trip with another loss. We blew a 2-0 in the third. That is a game that was in our hands and we just let it get away.
 A lucky goal came in the first with the puck hitting off Paul Byron's skate. A second goal coming form Plekanec, beautiful backhand in to the top left
 corner. But soon came St. Louis and they did not hold back. Briging the game into overtime, Jaden Schwartz finished the game tucking the puck in from
 a really nice pass coming form Alexander Steen. With Galchenyuk injured and Desharnais will the habs have troubles or will they continur to so well.
 Who do you think will take Gally's place and who will take Desharnais place? <pre> December 7, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> Half way through the season the Montreal Canadiens showing whats keeping them back and that is not playing at home. Now their is a question to ask,
 our they gonna be like this during the playoffs too. Because this could be the difference between going out in the second round and making it to the
 Stanley cup finals. The Habs show their dominance at home being 12-1-1. Almost unbeatable at home, but away from home being 5-5-1 at a below average
 record. Is this something they will be able to fix over the course of the season or are they just way more comfortable at home? Coming to the end
 of this five game away streak with two wins and two losses still having to play St.Louis. Will the habs shut down Tarasenko tomorrow or will he
 continue terror having six goals in his past five games? <pre> December 5, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The Montreal Canadiens played against Ottawa on the 22 and lost. Absolutely dominating them in the shooting category with 39 shots to 23. Unfortunately,
 Price had his first bad game. Letting in 4 out of 23 shots. Montreal played well but just could not keep the puck out of the net. Next came
 the Carolina Hurricanes, we lost to them only 6 days earlier. This was time for Montreal to show them that they just got lucky and they did. Winning
 the game 2-1 but this time getting out shot. It seams that the Habs win every game where they get dominated and lose every one they dominate.
 Next came a very intense game against Detroit. Detroit striking first in the 3rd period but Brendan Gallagher tipping in the shot of Plekanec
 with about 9 minutes left. The game does go to overtime due to good goaltending by Carey Price and Peter Mrazek. Not but a minute in, Weber
 taking a stupid penalty leaving the habs in a 4 on 3 for a long two minutes. Good penalty kill though by the Habs not letting them score. Shortly
 after Weber coming out of the box, Radulov and Galchenyuk hit Detroit with the counter attack, beautiful saucer pass by Radulov and nice tuck by
 Galchenyuk. <pre> November 28, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The 14-3-2 Montreal Canadiens had another slip but its not like they were gonna win every game. First came Florida which was a long 
 and hard fought battle to the end where Florida snuck in a lucky one in overtime. The habs first loss with Price in the net. In overtime 
 sticks were breaking all over the place. Montreal player skating to his bench too get a new stick when a slapshot came from the point 
 by Aaron Ekblad, snapping his stick and the puck going in the other direction just sneeking by Price. Another game dominated by Montreal but
 not scoring enough. Finally came the rivaled Toronto Maple Leafs, this time getting out shot by Toronto winning the game. The Habs are going to 
 have score more goals playing against a team like the Rangers who have 16 more goals for than the habs and only three more goals against. 
 Now lets talk about specific players like PAUL BYRON with a whopping seven goals tied for the most with Galchenyuk and Shea Weber. This guy doesnt 
 even have powerplay time and he is tied for most goals. He is surprising everyone with how good he is playing. Another player is Torey Mitchell 
 playing on the 4th line and has five goals. This is why the habs are doing so well with their depth. Once again I have to talk about Al Montoya, this 
 guy is just not cutting it. We need a back up that we can rely on to get some wins when Price is not in between the pipes. Price has still not lost 
 a game in regulation which shows how good this team actually is when comfortable with an above average goalie in the net. 
 Do you think we should get rid of Al Montoya and if so who should we trade and for whom? <pre> November 21, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The Canadiens coming off another L to the hands of Al Montoya. This one was not neccesarly Montoya's fault but if the habs wanna go for the cup 
 this year are they going to have to invest in a better back up goalie. The habs have no troubles with Carey in the net (still undefeated). They are 
 having a great season so far being 13-2-1 but can they be doing better. Montoya would have great stats for a back up if that 10-0 game didn't happen 
 but it doesn't seem that the rest of the team performs as well when Montoya is in between the pipes. If the habs wanna win, its going to have to be soon. 
 Salary issues will come into play with so many great players on this team.
 Do you think the habs need a better back up or is Montoya doing his job?  <pre> November 15, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The Canadians playing against the Los Angelas Kings yesterday continuing the great run. Even while getting out shot 24 to 23 the habs prevailed.
 Capitalizing on their chances and Carey playing his game. Galchenyuk continuing to be the top goal scorer on the habs gets another one while Radulov 
 continuing his assist spree. But we can not concentrate on two or three players for this team. This whole team is holding their weight. 
 Even the fouth line, the fouth line is doing their job and more but more specifically Torey Mitchell playing with 4th line ice time and getting 5 goals 
 already. But their is players that catch my attention. Specifically Shea Weber, Gally, Radulov and Carey Price. These four players are leading this 
 team to their wins. Shea Weber with an incredible 16+ on ice, Radulov having twelve points in 14 games while nine of them being assists, Gally rocking that 
 point a game average and Price with a .953 save percentage and a 1.56 goals against average. 
 Price has still not lost a game this season (knock on wood), being 9-0. </p> <pre> November 11, 2016 </pre>  </p>

<!--November 9 post-->
 <p> The Canadians are starting off the year with style. Getting off to a great start the habs are 11-1-1. Doing so well, why is that? Probably 
 because Price is back from injury or is it something else. Is Price really the whole Canadian team or have the pickups of Alexander Radulov and 
 Shea Weber shaped up this team. With only thirteen games played, Weber has already showed off his skills scoring 5 goals and having 6 assists while 
 Radulov also showing why he was worth picking up scoring three goals and having eight assists. But the question was, is Price the whole team; and even 
 with the impressive stats of our players, I am here to say YES. We saw what happens without Price when we played against Columbus. That might 
 have been the bigest blowout in NHL history. But have the canadians just come to a good start like we have all seen before or are they a team 
 to watch out for this time. They have about fourty goals for and were leading the league in goals against before the Columbus game. <pre> November 9, 2016 </pre> </p>
